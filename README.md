# Voice recognition by fundamental pitch
Determining the speaker's sex by determining the fundamental frequency

The fundamental frequency(pitch or F0) of spoken speech is the main difference between male and female voices. It alone is usually enough to classify the speaker's sex, without using information about pauses, glottal open quotient(GOQ), etc. 
This example uses simple machine learning methods & pitch estimation techniques (YAAPT, and the one used by praat) to demonstrate that.
